# ADR 1: NestJS as Authentication Service 

NestJS is a robust and mature framework for building scalable server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). It is a great choice for building the authentication service because it is well-suited for building microservices and has a strong ecosystem of libraries and tools. 

## Decision 

NestJS will be used as the authentication service for the image processing application.

## Rationale 

NestJS already has built-in support for authentication and authorization, which will make it easier to implement the required functionality. It also has a strong ecosystem of libraries and tools that will help us build a secure and scalable authentication service.

## Status
Proposed
