# ADR 2: JWT as auth protocol

JWT is a widely used authentication protocol that is secure, stateless, and easy to implement. It is a great choice for the authentication service because it is well-suited for building microservices and has a strong ecosystem of libraries and tools.

## Decision 

JWT will be used as the authentication protocol for the image processing application.

## Rationale 

JWT became the pattern adopted by the industry for authentication and authorization. It is a secure and stateless protocol that is easy to implement and has a strong ecosystem of libraries and tools that will help us build a secure and scalable authentication service.
