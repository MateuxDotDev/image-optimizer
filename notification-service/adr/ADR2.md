# ADR 2: TypeScript as Backend Language

TypeScript is basically a linter for JavaScript, but it is a great choice for the image processing application because it is well-suited for building scalable and reliable applications.

## Decision 

TypeScript will be used as the backend language for the image processing application.

## Rationale 

TypeScript is the main language behind Socket.io, and it is easy to use, alongside its type safety, which is essential for building a secure and scalable image processing application.

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences

- TypeScript will be used for the backend of the image processing application.
- All backend related tasks will be done using TypeScript.
